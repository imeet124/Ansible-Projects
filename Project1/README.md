Project: Deploy and Manage a Multi-Tier Web Application with Ansible
Project Overview
In this project, I used Ansible to automate the deployment and management of a multi-tier web application on AWS. The application will consist of a front-end web server, an application server, and a backend database server. You will use Ansible playbooks to configure and deploy these components, and implement tasks such as load balancing, SSL configuration, and monitoring.

Project Components
Infrastructure Setup:

Use Ansible to provision three EC2 instances on AWS: one for the web server, one for the application server, and one for the database server.
Configure security groups and ensure proper networking between the instances.
Web Server Setup:

Deploy an Nginx web server on the web server instance.
Configure Nginx to serve static content and forward dynamic requests to the application server.
Implement SSL using Let's Encrypt for HTTPS traffic.
Application Server Setup:

Deploy a Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js application on the application server instance.
Use Ansible to manage dependencies and application configurations.
Ensure the application server is running and configured to accept requests from the web server.
Database Server Setup:

Install and configure a MySQL/PostgreSQL database on the database server instance.
Create a database and user for the application.
Use Ansible to ensure that the database server is secured and properly configured.
Load Balancing:

Set up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) using Ansible to distribute traffic across multiple web server instances (you can scale up later).
Configure health checks to monitor the status of the web servers.
Continuous Deployment:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI that triggers an Ansible playbook to deploy updates to the application automatically whenever there's a new commit in the repository.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Use Ansible to install and configure a monitoring tool like Prometheus or Grafana on a dedicated monitoring server.
Set up alerts for critical metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, disk space).
Backup and Recovery: Implement automated database backups using Ansible.
Create playbooks for restoring the database from a backup in case of failure.

Project Deliverables
Ansible playbooks for each component (infrastructure setup, web server, app server, database, etc.)
A Git repository containing the Ansible project
Documentation explaining how to use the playbooks and any prerequisites
A working multi-tier application deployed on AWS
Extensions/Advanced Features
Implement zero-downtime deployments using Ansible.
Scale the web and application tiers horizontally based on load.
Use Ansible Vault to manage sensitive information (e.g., database passwords).
Automate DNS management to associate a domain name with the ELB.
This project will provide comprehensive hands-on experience with Ansible and familiarize you with real-world scenarios in deploying and managing a multi-tier application.
